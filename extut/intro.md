### Tutorial Overview

Hello!
In this tutorial we want to give a basic understanding for how you can use a Prometheus server to monitor your program. 

We will use a wine data set together with random forest classification. Why wine you might wonder? Well, you never know what can be in your bottle... To show how Prometheus works, we will log the accuracy and a counter based on how many times the program is run.
