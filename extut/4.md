Now we will create a function to actually run our model.-This function performs both the training and the evaluation on the data set.

```
def run_model():
    # Random selection of testing data
    test_split_ratio = random.uniform(0.1, 0.3)

    # Training and testing sets
    features_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=test_split_ratio)

    # Train the model on the training data
    model.fit(features_train, labels_train)

    # Make predictions on the test data
    test_predictions = model.predict(features_test)

    # Calculate the accuracy
    accuracy_score = model.score(features_test, labels_test)

    print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score}')           
    print(f'Predictions: {test_predictions}')    
```
