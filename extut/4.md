Now we will create a function to actually run our model. This function performs both the training and the evaluation on the data set. Add the function below to the Python file (below the previous lines).

```
def run_model():
    # Random selection of testing data
    test_split_ratio = random.uniform(0.1, 0.3)

    # Training and testing sets
    features_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test = train_test_split(wine.data, wine.target, test_size=test_split_ratio)

    # Train the model on the training data
    model.fit(features_train, labels_train)

    # Make predictions on the test data
    test_predictions = model.predict(features_test)

    # Calculate the accuracy
    accuracy_score = model.score(features_test, labels_test)

    print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score}')
    print(f'Predictions: {test_predictions}')

run_model()
```

The current version of the code is runnable. However, no monitoring is currently done using Prometheus. To run the model, use the following command:

```bash
python3 ml_logger.py
```
