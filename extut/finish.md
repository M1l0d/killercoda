## Good Job!

You have now completed the tutorial!

## What Does the Output Tell Us?

What we can see from the output is:
* The Prometheus metric *count_of_total_runs* shows 2, indicating that it has run twice.
* Test size varies between 0.1 and 0.3 each time which confirms we are sampling different portions of the dataset
* The predictions are changing for each run, which means that different test sets are generated each time
* Accuracy of the model per run is displayed
* *count_of_predictions_made_total* will show how many predictions have been made across all runs.

There are other metrics that show Pythons garbage collection which are auto generated for monitoring

### Thank You for going through this Tutorial!

Hopefully you now have a better understanding of Prometheus and how it can be used to monitor machine learning models.
