And now we have arrived to the part where we will actually do some DevOps!
Now we will start integrating Prometheus for some monitoring!

First of all, we want to add the prometheus library to the top of your file:

```
from prometheus_client import Counter, Gauge, start_http_server
```

Also, before the *run_model* function you want to define the metrics that we want to track while the model is running
```
model_run_counter = Counter('count_of_runs', 'The count of amount of times model has run')
accuracy_metric = Gauge('accuracy_of_model', 'The accuracy of the model for this run')
prediction_counter = Counter('count_of_predictions_made', 'The count of predictions model has made')
```
