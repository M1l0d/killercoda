Use Nano or any text editor to open the python file:

```bash
nano ml_logger.py
```


Use this following code to import libraries, specifically to load the wine library in the Prometheus ship ;), and to define the Random Forest model:


```
import random
from sklearn.datasets import load_wine
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

wine = load_wine()
model = RandomForestClassifier()
```

Do not close the text editor yet, as more parts are to be added.
