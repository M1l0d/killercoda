## Create New Directory and Python File

Run the following commands to create and navigate to a new directory called **"ML_prometheus"**:

```bash
mkdir ~/ML_prometheus
cd ~/ML_prometheus
```

Run this command to create a new Python file named **ml_logger.py**. This is where we will implement the machine learning model and use Prometheus to monitor certain aspects.

```bash
touch ml_logger.py
```

To be sure that the directory and file is correctly setup, the ```ls``` command can be used. The **ml_logger.py** should be visible in the directory.
